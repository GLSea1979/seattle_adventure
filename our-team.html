          <h3>Collin Smith</h3>
          <p>Collin grew up in Eastern Washington working on the family orchard while in school before going to Wenatchee Valley College, Washington State University and Central Washington University wasting 6 years of his life getting degrees. He eventually joined the Army, made selection for 2/75th Ranger Battalion, was stationed in Fort Lewis, and deployed 4 times.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<a href="https://github.com/alisonramer"> Alison's Github page</a></p>
